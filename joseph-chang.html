   <p>My name is Joseph Chang. I am a Senior at Rutgers University majoring in ITI and minoring in business administration. I was a pre-business student here at the Rutgers Business School until I decided to switch into the ITI program. Given that I have completed the majority of the requirements for the Business Administration degree, I felt that it was a simple decision in what my minor would be.

I am from South Brunswick which for those of you who aren’t familiar with central jersey, it is near princeton. Honestly, I don’t really enjoy or understand the point of college. If it was just as easy to get the jobs that I wanted without a college degree, I would definitely not be in school right now. Unfortunately, given the current standards and expectations of employers, I feel like I do not have any other option but to attend college and complete my degree.
</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I feel that most jobs will teach the new hires while working, and the hiring factors are just GPA and degree, as well as personality. I do hope that one day this will change. A lot of people brilliant people are unable to afford higher education, and therefore are not even considered for the majority of jobs. Maybe I just don’t see the point of college, but I don’t think it should be a requirement. Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy many aspects of college, but school in general isn’t for me. The way things are taught, doesn’t really mesh with how I personally learn.  </p>

I am a brother of Delta Sigma Phi, which is an fraternity here at Rutgers. I crossed into the fraternity my sophomore year, spring of 2017. Currently in my free time, I watch netflix and other media sources, as well as applying for jobs and internships. Obviously don’t really enjoy all the job applications, but with all the pressure rising up, I don’t really have a choice.\
