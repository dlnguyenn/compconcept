	<h1> About Me: </h1>
<img src = "David picture.jpg">
<p> My name is David Kim. I am a junior at Rutgers University. I am from Bergen County, NJ. I am Korean but have never gone to Korea and now I am not legally allowed to visit Korea. One of my biggest dreams is to travel all around the world. My favorite cartoon growing up was Calvin and Hobbes. </p>
<p> In my free time I like to read. Here is an excerpt from the book I am reading right now:</p>
<p> "Up and down the lanes, the last unevacuated townspeople wake, groan, sigh. Spinsters, prostitutes, men over sixty. Procrastinators, collaborators, disbelievers, drunks. Nuns of every order. The poor. The stubborn. The blind. </p>

<p> Some hurry to bomb shelters. Some tell themselves it is merely a drill. Some linger to grab a blanket or a prayer book or a deck of playing cards. </p>

<p> D-day was two months ago. Cherbourg has been liberated, Caen liberated, Rennes too. Half of western France is free. In the east, the Soviets have retaken Minsk; the Polish Home Army is revolting in Warsaw; a few newspapers have become bold enough to suggest that the tide has turned. </p>

<p> But not here. Not this last citadel at the edge of the continent, this final German strongpoint on the Breton coast. </p>

<p> Here, people whisper, the Germans have renovated two kilometers of subterranean corridors under the medieval walls; they have built new defenses, new conduits, new escape routes, underground complexes of bewildering intricacy. Beneath the peninsular fort of La Cité, across the river from the old city, there are rooms of bandages, rooms of ammunition, even an underground hospital, or so it is believed. There is air-conditioning, a two-hundred-thousand-liter water tank, a direct line to Berlin. There are flame-throwing booby traps, a net of pillboxes with periscopic sights; they have stockpiled enough ordnance to spray shells into the sea all day, every day, for a year. </p>

<p> Here, they whisper, are a thousand Germans ready to die. Or five thousand. Maybe more. </p>

<p> Saint-Malo: Water surrounds the city on four sides. Its link to the rest of France is tenuous: a causeway, a bridge, a spit of sand. We are Malouins first, say the people of Saint-Malo. Bretons next. French if there’s anything left over." </p>
