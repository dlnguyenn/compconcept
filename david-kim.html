<p> My name is David Kim. I am a junior at Rutgers University majoring in ITI (though, I feel that's a given because I'm pretty sure we can only take this class if we're majoring in ITI) and minoring in Psychology. I am from Bergen County, NJ. One of my biggest dreams is to travel all around the world. My favorite cartoon growing up was Calvin and Hobbes. </p>
<p> In my free time I like to read. Right now I am reading a book called <i> All the Light We Cannot See </i> and it is one of my favorite books right now. I highly recommend it! It follows the story of a blind French girl and a German boy in the midst of WWII who are doing their best to survive by following their perspectives. I believe they end up meeting at some point of the story, merging the plotlines; however, I haven't reached that point yet.
Thankfully, my friend assured me that this wasn't going to be a story that somehow created a love story in the midst of WWII and instead, is just a feel good, "restore faith in humanity" kind of story.</p>
<p> I also love to watch Netflix! Like many others, my all time favorite show on Netflix is the Office. I think that show is amazing considering how much the show thrives under unusual and highly awkward scenarios.
  Basing humor primarily off of reactions and faux pas moments make it that much more enjoyable. For example, my favorite episode is "The Dinner Party" where the character Michael Scott essentially has an enormous squabble with his girlfriend Jan at a dinner party where they are hosting.
  The uncomfortable reactions and awkward tension in the episode is so unbearable and ridiculous I can't help but laugh at it all the time.
  Although I rave about the Office, the first time I watched it, I initially hated it. I thought, "How could something so ridiculous and rude and racist be allowed to air? How could people like this show?
  What is wrong with people?" However, after rewatching it the second time not too long after I finished it, I couldn't stop laughing at a show so hilarious! I always wonder if my humor just changed over time or if I just took everything from the show with a grain of salt... probably both. </p>
<p> Another hobby I have is coffee brewing. At face value, when I tell people that, they respond with, "Oh, so you just think you're better than Starbucks huh?" But there's so much more depth that can come with coffee. It's not just some
  bitter beverage that should only be consumed to extract the caffeine out of it. Home brewing your own coffee with the entire process, grinding the beans, boiling the water, brewing the coffee, enjoying, is therapeutic on its own and its soothing to me.
  Good coffee isn'st bitter, there's so many subtle note flavors that can be experienced, an acidity and brightness that is just so amazing. Why force yourself to suffer drinking poor quality, disgustingly bitter coffee when the experience can be elevated a thousand fold?
  However, I will admit that if you just want the caffeine, then it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. To you, I might just sound like a pretentious coffee snob, to someone else, they may agree with everything I just said. To each their own!
  I think that's what makes humanity so united yet so divided, the ability (or inability) to agree to disagree...
