   <h1>About Me:</h1>
  <img src="itme.jpg" onmouseover= "this.src='itmeagain.jpg'" onmouseout= "this.src='itme.jpg'" alt="Danny" hspace="20">
  <p>My name is Dan. I am a junior. I am studying Information Technology. + I am a part of Nu Alpha Phi fraternity, which is an Asian-interest social fraternity here at Rutgers.  Currently, I spend most of my time either working on school, my career, or my fraternity.  I love to talk to others.  I also love reading.  One of the craziest things I did this semester was put my tuition refund into stocks and lose all of it due to a market crash. <br><br>
  	At first, I was getting lots of money.  My return was 80%. <br><br>
  	However, when I woke up one day, all of it was gone. <br><br>
  	Well, in reality, half of it was gone. <br><br>
  	Thinking that if I waited the price would go back up again, I waited. <br><br>
  	It only went back down. <br><br>
  	It did not feel real. <br><br>
  	However, although now I am not rich in wealth, <br><br>
  	I am rich in knowledge. <br><br>
