  <p > <b><h2>Be Like Water.</h2></b> 
  <br/> Be like water,
Bruce Lee once said. <br/>
I heard it from his daughter, <br/>
And now Bruce Lee is dead. <br/>
<br/>
I try to understand what it means.<br/>
It means to flow,<br/>
But I have a mind of a bean.<br/>
I dont really know. <br/>
<br/>
I understand water is gentle and strong. <br/>
But that sounds like a contradiction.<br/>
Maybe I should write a song,<br/>
And sing about my addiction. <br/>
<br/>
I dont get it,<br/>
Im losing my mind. <br/>
I need the answer, I must admit.<br/>
I know its worth the find. <br/>
<br/>
I wish I could ask Bruce Lee myself,<br/>
So I can be like water.<br/>
I wanna move on and put this on a shelf.<br/>
I need to know the meaning from the author. <br/>
<br/>
To be like water, I guess its out of reach.<br/>
Ive let it go, maybe Ill be like air.<br/>
Ive stopped seeking, then it came to me at the beach.<br/>
To know the answer, water would not care.  <br/>
