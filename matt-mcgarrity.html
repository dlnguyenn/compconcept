		<p> My name is Matt, I am from Readington New Jersey and I went to high school in Flemington
			at Hunterdon Central. I'm a junior and I'm in Army ROTC at Rutgers and I've been in the National Guard for about 
			three years. After my military career I want to go into law enforcement. Over the summers
			I spend my time working and going to the beach. I work for PSE&G over the summers and
			have a beach house in Seaside Park, New Jersey. I also have a motorcycle and like to go
			riding as often as I can. I also like to go fishing and do other things outdoors during the
			summer.
