		<p> My name is Matt, I am from Readington New Jersey and I went to high school in Flemington
			at Hunterdon Central. I'm a junior and I'm in Army ROTC at Rutgers and I've been in the National Guard for about 
			three years. After my military career I want to go into law enforcement. Over the summers
			I spend my time working and going to the beach. I work for PSE&G over the summers and
			have a beach house in Seaside Park, New Jersey. I also have a motorcycle and like to go
			riding as often as I can. I also like to go fishing and do other things outdoors during the
			summer. <br/>
			Now here is Country Roads by John Denver. <br/>
			
			Almost heaven, West Virginia <br/>
			Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River <br/>
			Life is old there, older than the trees <br/>
			Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze <br/>
			
			Country roads, take me home <br/>
			To the place I belong <br/>
			West Virginia, mountain mama <br/>
			Take me home, country roads <br/>
			
			All my memories gather round her <br/>
			Miner's lady, stranger to blue water <br/>
			Dark and dusty, painted on the sky <br/>
			Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye <br/>
			
			Country roads, take me home <br/>
			To the place I belong <br/>
			West Virginia, mountain mama <br/>
			Take me home, country roads <br/>
			
			I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me <br/>
			The radio reminds me of my home far away <br/>
			And driving down the road I get a feeling <br/>
			That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday <br/>
			
			Country roads, take me home <br/>
			To the place I belong <br/>
			West Virginia, mountain mama <br/>
			Take me home, country roads <br/>
			Country roads, take me home <br/>
			To the place I belong <br/>
			West Virginia, mountain mama <br/>
			Take me home, country roads <br/>
			Take me home, down country roads <br/>
			Take me home, down country roads <br/>
